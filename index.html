<h4 id="questions">What are two of you favorite somethings?</h4>
<br>
My favorite books are:
<li>A child called it</li>
<li>The Lost Boy</li>
The books are both written by the same author (Dave Pelzer). I like them because
they are very eye opening. The books are autobiographies where he was abused by his mom
and was put in multiple foster homes.
<br>
<br>
-My favorite movies are:
<li>Donnie Darko</li>
<li>Captain America: Civil War </li>
Donnie Darko is literally a dark movie. It full of emotions and is
about a guy who is figuring out what it means to be alive.
As for Civil War. It overal is a great movie.
<br>

<h4 id="questions">Hobbies</h4>
<br>
Right now, I think basketball is one of my hobbies. I like basketball because
I get to be fit and am able to cooperate with others. I got into basketball my
sophomore year. My friend wanted me to join with her. My favorite part about
playing basketball is that you get many friendships out of it.
